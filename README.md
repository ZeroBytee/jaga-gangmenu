# QB-VAB
**INSTALLATION**
1) Make sure you **rename the folder to QB-VAB** and not keep the default downloaded folder called QB-VAB-main
2) Put the folder in the *[Standalone]* folder, and restart the server

**USAGE**
the command to repair the vehicle is **/repairveh** (*This command only works if you are in duty, and have the mechanic role!*)
*the radius is currently set to 5, so make sure your not too far from the vehicle. I recommend standing next to the steering wheel and facing the car*
